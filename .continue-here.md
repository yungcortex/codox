# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for Codox. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** Complete
- Core concept defined: Advanced wavetable synthesizer (Serum 2 feature parity)
- Architecture specified: 2 wavetable + sub + noise oscillators
- Modulation: 4 LFOs + 3 envelopes + mod matrix
- Effects: Full rack (10+ effects)
- Filters: 20+ types
- Voices: 16 poly, 16 unison max
- Wavetables: Library + import + editor
- Use cases identified: All genres / versatile workhorse

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly (phased approach recommended due to complexity)
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Wavetable)
- Core concept: Serum 2-level wavetable synthesizer with unique visual identity
- Special features: Randomize button, internal automation, full warp modes

**Complexity Note:**
This is a very ambitious project. Recommended implementation phases:
1. Core oscillators + basic filter + amp envelope
2. Full filter set + mod matrix
3. Effects rack
4. Wavetable import/editor
5. Full UI polish
